  "prompt": "A close-up photograph of a modern smartphone (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro) held in a hand, displaying the mobile version of the 'Shield of Achilles | Story Fracture' IDE. The screen is dark, glowing with bronze and cyan light. At the top is a compact header: 'Iliad > Bk XVIII > City at War | Depth: 2'. Below it, a large square viewport dominates, showing the 3D voxel shield rotating. The 'City at War' section is actively fracturing into glowing cyan voxels, spraying outwards. Verse markers 'BkXVIII:490' and 'BkXVIII:510' hover. Overlaid in the bottom-left of the shield view are semi-transparent sliders for 'Narrative Peel (60%)' and 'Relief Height'. Below the shield view are two collapsed cyberpunk accordion panels with glowing borders: 'THE FORGE [Palette: Scene]' and 'INSPECTOR [Action: FRACTURE SECTOR]'. At the very bottom, a prominent, sticky footer bar holds a large, glowing bronze button labeled 'FORGE', emitting digital sparks and cyan light onto the phone's bezel. The background is a dimly lit desk with a mechanical keyboard, maintaining the atmosphere of the previous desktop image. The UI font is JetBrains Mono and Cinzel.",
